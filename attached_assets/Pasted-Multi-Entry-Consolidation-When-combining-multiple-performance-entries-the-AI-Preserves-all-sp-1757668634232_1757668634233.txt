Multi-Entry Consolidation:
When combining multiple performance entries, the AI:

Preserves all specific numbers and operation names
Identifies common themes and related achievements
Creates logical action→impact→result flow
Maintains Air Force narrative standards
Outputs single cohesive statement or multiple distinct statements based on user preference
🎯 User Journey: Performance Entry → Professional Statement
Complete Workflow:
Add Win Screen: User captures raw performance data (Action/Impact/Result)
Library Screen: Entries accumulate and can be searched/filtered
Statements Screen:
Select relevant entries
Choose generation mode (single/combine/multiple)
AI transforms entries into professional statements
CreateStatementsScreen:
Edit generated statements with synonym suggestions
Get AI feedback and ask-back questions
Regenerate improved versions
Export Screen: Generate professional documents for EPB submission
Example Transformation:
Raw Entry (Add Win):

Action: "Fixed aircraft engine problems"
Impact: "Got planes working again"
Result: "Mission continued"
Generated Statement (Statements Screen): "Executed comprehensive troubleshooting procedures on 15 engine discrepancies affecting critical airlift operations--restored 12 aircraft to mission-ready status within 48 hours--sustained 95% sortie completion rate during Operation Freedom's Sentinel"

🏗️ Technical Implementation
State Management:
Generation Modes:
Single Entry: Direct refinement and enhancement
Multiple Combine: Intelligent consolidation into one statement
Multiple Separate: Create distinct statements from selection
AI Integration:
Uses same useAIGeneration hook as other screens
Specialized prompts for statement generation vs. refinement
Preserves quantitative data and specific context
Enforces Air Force narrative standards
The Statements Screen is the critical bridge between raw performance tracking and professional military documentation, transforming everyday achievements into promotion-worthy narrative statements through intelligent AI processing.
