Key Issues

You’re still passing temperature for GPT-5

Reasoning models (like gpt-5) do not support temperature or top_p.

In both generateAIFeedback and generateAskBackQuestions you call:

gpt5Text(prompt, { max: 500, temperature: 0.2, jsonSchema: ..., ... })


This will either be ignored or throw errors.

✅ Fix: Remove temperature completely. Use reasoning.effort and text.verbosity if you need to steer output.

Output extraction

You handle resp.output and resp.output_text fallback correctly.

Good job — but ensure you always log resp.usage so you can see if reasoning tokens are consuming the whole budget.

Token budgeting

reasoning: { effort: "minimal" } is correct.

But in some functions you set max: 200 or max: 500. If GPT-5 spends all 200/500 on reasoning, you’ll still get empty final text.

✅ Fix: Keep max_output_tokens high (e.g. 512) and let “effort: minimal” prevent overthinking.

JSON schema mode

You set:

text: {
  verbosity: "medium",
  format: {
    type: "json_schema",
    json_schema: { ... }
  }
}


That’s correct. Just be sure to not combine with temperature — the model will honor the schema best in deterministic mode.

General clarity

In generateFirstDraft you request “combine related achievements intelligently” but limit to 350 characters. Sometimes combining multiple wins will exceed 350.

✅ Suggestion: Relax to 2 statements max, or clarify “compress into ≤350 characters.”

✅ What to Tell Replit

Here’s what you can send them directly:

The code is almost right, but two things break GPT-5:

Remove temperature – Reasoning models don’t support it. In generateAIFeedback and generateAskBackQuestions calls, delete temperature: 0.2.

Token budgeting – Keep max_output_tokens fairly high (≥512) and always set reasoning: { effort: "minimal" } so the model leaves tokens for final output.

Updated example call:

const content = await gpt5Text(prompt, { 
  max: 512, 
  jsonSchema: feedbackSchema, 
  jsonName: "Feedback", 
  instructions 
});


With that fix, GPT-5 should produce non-empty output instead of burning all tokens on reasoning.
