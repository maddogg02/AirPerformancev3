Revised Feature Plan for Replit

Keep these (core to your app):

✅ User authentication (so statements/wins are tied to individual accounts)

✅ Add Win screen (3-field AIR format → Action, Impact, Result)

✅ Library screen (two collections: Wins + Statements, searchable by category/MPA)

✅ AI-powered Statements screen (first draft generation + refinement loop)

✅ Statement refinement system (AI feedback, ask-backs, synonym suggestions, regeneration, character count enforcement)

✅ Performance categorization (the 5 Major Performance Areas)

✅ Real-time validation & 350-character enforcement

Modify these (to better fit your workflow):

🟡 Dashboard → Keep it simple:

Quick link to “Add Win”

Count of Wins and Statements

Optional “Last 3 Saved Statements” for quick access
(Drop XP/badges/streaks — not your audience.)

🟡 Export → Start basic:

Export single statement as plain text

Later expand to batch PDF/DOCX if needed

Drop these (not aligned with your goals right now):

❌ Gamified XP, streaks, badges (feels like fluff, won’t help adoption)

❌ EPB countdown timer (adds stress, not structure — unless you really want it later)

❌ Voice input (cool, but premature and complicates dev)

🚀 Suggested Flow (What Replit Should Build)
Bottom Navigation (4 tabs instead of 5)

Wins (capture raw AIR entries)

Statements (generate/refine/save bullets)

Library (browse/search Wins + Statements by category)

Account (basic settings + logout)

Refinement Flow (Mandatory, Sequential)

Step 1: 📝 First Draft (AI-generated)

Step 2: 🔍 What the AI Noticed (feedback)

Step 3: ❓ Help Improve This (ask-backs, must answer 2/3 before regeneration)

Step 4: 💡 Synonym Suggestions (optional, collapsed)

Step 5: 💾 Save to Library (unlocks only after regeneration with ask-backs)

📝 What to Send Replit
Revise the plan to focus on the core refinement workflow. Please remove XP system, streaks, badges, and countdown timer. Replace Dashboard with a simple overview showing "Add Win" shortcut, count of Wins/Statements, and last 3 saved statements. Voice input and fancy exports are not needed yet — just keep basic text export.

The app should center on two main collections:
- Wins (raw AIR entries)
- Statements (refined outputs)

Navigation should have 4 tabs: Wins, Statements, Library, Account.

The refinement flow must be mandatory and step-based:
Step 1: First Draft
Step 2: What the AI Noticed
Step 3: Help Improve This (user must answer 2 of 3 ask-backs before regeneration)
Step 4: Synonym Suggestions (optional)
Step 5: Save to Library (unlocked after regeneration)

Character count (350 max) should be enforced everywhere. AI prompts for draft, feedb
